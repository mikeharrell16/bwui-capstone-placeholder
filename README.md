I was unable to add accessibiilty for screen readers and HTML5 markups as I ran out of time. My time was limited due to increase in work and finally being able to schedule back surgery. Recovery has dramatically cut down my ability to work on a computer. I submitted this in the best shape that I could. If this was for a customer, I feel that the changes I have made would absolutely increase conversions on their site as it has made usability much better than what it was.
